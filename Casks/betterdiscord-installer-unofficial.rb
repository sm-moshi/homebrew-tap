      Supports Discord Stable, PTB, Canary, and Development. Ensure at least one of these is installed; the installer will detect installed editions.
      This app may fail Gatekeeper checks (unsigned/not notarized).
      If macOS blocks it, use: Right-click → Open (once), or install with:
        HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--no-quarantine" brew install --cask sm-moshi/moshi/betterdiscord-installer-unofficial
